1) DecisionTreeClassifier constructor should take training strategy as an
   argument. DONE

2) predict() should return the predictions made instead of storing them
   internally.

3) Decouple DecisionTreeClassifier from data it uses and pass data to train()
   method.  This will help cut down on the amount of state information that
   is being stored in the classifier even after training and testing take
   place even though it isn't entirely neccesary.

4) Class that encapsulates training and test data that knows how to split the
   data in different ways, retrieve values.
