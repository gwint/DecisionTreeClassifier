1) Setup http server so that classifier can be used via http requests
  1.1) Server needs to specify machine on which it's running via command-line
       arguments.
2) Why is npv low while ppv is decent?
3) classes.txt file needs to be seperated by commas and readCSV() needs to be
   able to parse a file with that format.
4) Add ability to parse data from http request to decision tree classifier
5) Figure out how to format response
